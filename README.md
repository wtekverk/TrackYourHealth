## Description
This project cis a deployed fitness tracker that tracks the exercises in you workouts and the frequency and quantity of he minutes and pounds used in those workouts. This project helps the user track their overall fitness so they can easily work towards goals and keep track of how close they are. I had a lot of fun but also difficulty with this app and getting all of my connection to work correctly with the given code but over all I think it came out very well.
